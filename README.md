## Welcome to Skylar Stolte's webpage!
Skylar Stolte is pursuing her Ph.D. degree at the University of Florida J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering. Dr. Ruogu Fang is her Ph.D. advisor. Her research broadly focuses on the use of artificial intelligence to analyze multimodal biomedical data. In general, her goal involves designing systems that harness machine learning and deep learning systems to assist in diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. Her current work seeks to combine total variation regularization and deep learning to optimize the generation of perfusion maps from computed tomography (CT) scans. 
Address: J. Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, 1275 Center Dr, Gainesville, FL, USA
